# Manuscriptus Pro
Manuscriptus Pro is my final project for uWaterloo's Digital History (HIST 303) course. It is a web-based application (written in PHP and using MySQL) designed to facilitate and organize the preparation of textual corpuses and critical editions. One can create corpuses, add manuscripts to a corpus, and add lines to a manuscript. Manuscripts can be searched, compared, annotated, and exported for further use. Although it is web-based, it is also designed to be used locally (via MAMP or other environments) and so can be used both online for collaborative work or offline for individual work.
